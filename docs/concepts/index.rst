Scientific Concepts
==================

This section explores the fundamental scientific concepts underlying morphogenesis research and how our platform models these biological phenomena.

.. note::
   These concept guides bridge biology and computation, making them accessible to both biologists learning computational methods and computer scientists learning biology.

What is Morphogenesis?
----------------------

**Morphogenesis** is one of the most fascinating processes in biology - how living organisms develop their complex shapes and structures. From a single fertilized egg, billions of cells must coordinate to create intricate organs, tissues, and body plans with remarkable precision and reliability.

The word comes from Greek: *morphe* (shape) + *genesis* (creation) = "creation of shape."
