Here are some of our most popular and educational examples:

1. Cell Sorting in Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Biological Context:**
   During embryonic development, initially mixed populations of cells sort themselves into distinct tissues. This process is fundamental to forming organ boundaries and tissue architecture.

**What You'll Learn:**
   * How differential adhesion drives cell sorting
   * The relationship between local cellular behavior and global tissue organization
   * Methods for quantifying sorting efficiency and emergence

**Research Applications:**
   * Understanding congenital defects where sorting fails
   * Designing tissue engineering protocols
   * Studying cancer cell invasion (reverse sorting)

.. code-block:: python

   # Quick preview of the cell sorting example
   from examples.basic.cell_sorting import CellSortingExperiment

   experiment = CellSortingExperiment(
       population_size=200,
       cell_types=['epithelial', 'mesenchymal'],
       adhesion_difference=0.3
   )

   results = await experiment.run()
   print(f"Sorting efficiency: {results.sorting_score:.2f}")

2. Wound Healing Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Biological Context:**
   When tissues are injured, cells coordinate to close wounds through migration, proliferation, and matrix remodeling. This process involves complex signaling cascades and mechanical forces.

**What You'll Learn:**

   * Testing wound healing drugs computationally
   * Optimizing tissue engineering scaffold design

3. Neural Network Self-Organization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
