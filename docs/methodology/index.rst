Common Research Patterns
-----------------------

**1. Parameter Sensitivity Studies**

Understanding how model parameters affect outcomes:

* **Single Parameter Sensitivity**: Vary one parameter while holding others constant
* **Multi-Parameter Sensitivity**: Use design of experiments to explore interactions
* **Global Sensitivity Analysis**: Assess parameter importance across entire parameter space

**2. Model Validation Studies**

Ensuring your models accurately represent biological reality:

* **Face Validity**: Does the model behavior look reasonable?
* **Construct Validity**: Does the model capture the intended biological mechanisms?
* **Predictive Validity**: Can the model predict new experimental results?

**3. Comparative Algorithm Studies**

Comparing different morphogenetic algorithms:

* **Performance Comparison**: Which algorithm works better under what conditions?
* **Mechanism Analysis**: Why do algorithms perform differently?
* **Robustness Testing**: How sensitive are algorithms to parameter changes?

**4. Emergence Detection Studies**

Identifying when collective behavior emerges from individual actions:

* **Emergence Metrics**: Quantifying the degree of emergent behavior
* **Critical Transitions**: Finding parameter values where emergence occurs
* **Mechanism Identification**: Understanding what drives emergent behavior
